# Contributing
Contributions are welcome from the community. For questions and discussion threads see the CEDS [CEDS Community of Practice website](https://ceds.communities.ed.gov/#program).

## Submitting Code Changes
Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CEDStandards/CEDS-Elements/issues) to submit a bug fix or enhancement to the CEDS Elements. 

To propose any change, the Contributor must submit a use case complete and a pull request. Note that changes to element names and option set codes will result in a breaking change to the standard and require solid reasoning for the change. Changes to definitions and descriptions, as long as they do not change the existing meaning of an element name or option set code, are not considered breaking changes. New elements and option sets are also not considered breaking changes. Use cases will be reviewed by the Maintainers. If additional information is required to support the proposed code changes, the Contributor will update the existing use case and/or provide a new use case. 
Before proposing new elements, the Contributor must verify that the element does not already exist in CEDS under a different name. This can be done by: 

* going to the Domain Entity Schema in CEDS and searching for elements by various domains and entities.
* going to the Elements search page and searching for different variations of the element name or words that may appear in a definition about the element.
* contacting CEDS support to confirm the element does not exist.
* checking with existing education standards to see if the element exists in their standard. CEDS is committed to using standard elements and definitions that already exist when adding to the CEDS standard. If the element you need exists in one or more of these standards, indicate that information in the use case. Below are some standards to review:
     * [Access 4 Learning](https://www.a4l.org/default.aspx)
     * [Ed-Fi](https://www.ed-fi.org/)
     * [PESC](https://www.pesc.org/)
     * [IMS Global](https://www.imsglobal.org/)
